                <p>Kareen Clair Soffer is an educator, behavioral therapist, creative producer, and thanks to <i>King Nothing</i>, now author. She decided to put her last name, Soffer, to good use – it means scribe in her second language, Hebrew.</p>
                <p>Being a New York State certified Early Childhood General and Special Education teacher, Kareen fell in love with finding the most enjoyable books for children to read and listen to. She has spent many years as a Special Educator in New York City reading as many early childhood books as possible and concocting a secret formula for what makes the most enjoyable reading experience. Kareen has learned which qualities of a book keep children on their toes, what draws an emotional response, and what makes them want to carry out the message they have learned and bring to their own lives.</p>
                <p>As an educator and metal music lover, Kareen has always envisioned turning songs with great messages into children’s books.  <i>King Nothing</i>, Kareen’s first book, is inspired by the heavy metal band Metallica song “King Nothing”, and is just one of the many songs she would like to transform into a children’s story.  Long live heavy metal!</p>
